Limitations of Our Shell:
Cannot run the commands like cd as we cant change the current directory of our shell programme
We haven't given any background support so all those command cant run like bg and fg
We don't access internal env variables so we cant do commands like echo $USER etc
We haven't used io redirection to transfer one command output to another file

DESIGN:
We have a parent shell programme which calls some child process using excevp with some commands and arguments, and those commands get executed
We added functionality for pipes using pair of file descriptors and also created structure to make history for our shell and used signal handler to exit the shell after pressing ctrl c and history gets printed after that
