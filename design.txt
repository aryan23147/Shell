Limitations of Our Shell
Cannot run the commands like cd as we cant change the current directory of our shell programme
We haven't given any background support so all those command cant run like bg and fg
We don't access internal env variables so we cant do commands like echo $USER etc
We haven't used io redirection to transfer one command output to another file
Grp no.
